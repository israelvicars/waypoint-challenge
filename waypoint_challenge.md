# Waypoint Learning: The Special Education Challenge

Build an MCP server that helps a teacher differentiate instruction for a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP).

**Prize:** $500 to the winner. Top 5 submissions get an immediate final-round interview for the founding engineer role at Waypoint Learning The challenge is designed to take no more than a few hours.

**Deadline:** Monday, May 11 @ 12pm ET

## The Challenge

Almost 10 million U.S. students have IEPs — legally binding documents that describe exactly what a student needs in the classroom every day. But teachers can't act on them well, because translating a 20+ page IEP into a modified version of tomorrow's lesson takes hours of prep they don't have.

Your job: build an MCP server that gives Claude the context it needs to help a teacher do this in minutes instead of hours.

Given a lesson and a student's IEP, the system should produce **specific, actionable instructional modifications** — scaffolded questions, modified materials, alternative assessments, accommodation reminders. Things a teacher can actually use in the classroom.

## What's in This Repo

lesson/           # Sample lesson from a real K-8 curriculum

iep/              # Sample IEP document (anonymized)

README.md

## What You'll Build

An MCP server (TypeScript or Python) that:

1. Exposes the curriculum and IEP data to Claude as resources and/or tools
2. Lets Claude reason about the intersection of a specific lesson and a specific student's needs
3. Produces concrete modifications a teacher can use without further editing

The architecture is up to you. Some questions worth thinking through:

- How do you chunk and surface the IEP so Claude can reason about goals, accommodations, and present levels effectively?
- How do you ground modifications in *both* the curriculum and the IEP, rather than producing generic strategies?
- What does the teacher actually see and how to they easily navigate the UI/UX of the tool? 

Feel free to research Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and other pedagogical frameworks. The ability to learn quickly is part of what we're evaluating.

This is intentionally open-ended. There's no single "right" architecture. We want to see how you think about structuring domain data for an LLM: what becomes a resource, what becomes a tool, how you handle context, and whether the output is actually useful to a teacher. A thoughtful, well-structured solution that handles one lesson well is better than a sprawling system that handles many lessons poorly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for TypeScript) **or** Python 3.10+ (for Python)
- An Anthropic API key or Claude Desktop installed
- Familiarity with the [Model Context Protocol]

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igoldstein19/waypoint-challenge.git
cd waypoint-challenge
```

## Evaluation Criteria

We'll evaluate submissions on four dimensions:

| Dimension | What we're looking for |
|---|---|
| **Output quality** | Are the instructional modifications specific, actionable, and grounded in both the curriculum and the IEP? Would a real teacher use this? |
| **Architecture decisions** | How did you structure curriculum and IEP data for Claude? What trade-offs did you make and why? Your README should explain this. |
| **Code quality** | Clean, readable, well-organized. Comments where they matter. Tests if you have time. |
| **Domain understanding** | Does the solution reflect real thinking about what a teacher needs, not just what's technically interesting? How did you provide additional context that increased the quality of output? |

## How to Submit

1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repo**
2. Include a README that:
   - Explains how to run your server
   - Walks through your architecture decisions
   - Shows 1-2 example outputs (lesson + IEP → modifications)
3. Email **isaac@waypoint-learning.org** with:
   - Subject: `Waypoint Challenge: [Your Name]`
   - A link to your repo
   - (Optional) A short demo video

**Deadline: Monday, May 11 @ 12pm ET.** Late submissions won't be considered.

## FAQ

**Can I use models other than Claude?**
Yes, feel free.

**Can I team up?**
Solo submissions only for this round.

**What if it's taking too long?**
A focused, partial solution with clear thinking beats nothing.

**Can I use additional libraries / RAG / fine-tuning / etc.?**
Yes. Use whatever helps you build the best solution.

**I have a question that isn't here.**
Comment in HN or email isaac@waypoint-learning.org.

## A Note on the Data

Please don't redistribute these materials outside the context of this challenge.

## About the Role

We're looking for a founding engineer who wants to build the technical foundation of a company that could genuinely change how millions of students experience school. You'd be working directly with me (Isaac) to go from MVP to full product.

The work involves building AI-powered tools for teachers — ingesting and understanding curriculum, reasoning about IEPs, generating actionable instructional modifications, automating reporting workflows, and creating tight feedback loops so teachers know what's working. The stack is early and flexible.

This role is ideal for a strong engineer who wants massive ownership, cares about education, and is excited about building with LLMs in a domain where the work genuinely matters.

## About Waypoint Learning

Waypoint is building AI tools that help teachers serve students with disabilities by both streamlining administrative work and supporting fundamentally better instruction. We believe the highest-leverage point in education is the teacher, and the hardest thing teachers do is differentiate instruction for students with diverse learning needs.

Founder & CEO: Isaac Goldstein studied CS at Stanford and is finishing is MBA at Harvard. He hasive years in education at EY-Parthenon, BCG, and Great Minds, where he led a 330-person curriculum implementation team - and he's looking to partner with a great engineer to build a very impactful business.
